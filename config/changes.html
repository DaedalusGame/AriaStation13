- There's a completely new map made from scratch by Harryb412 and BordListian; It's supposed to be a lot more compact than the default Bay12 and /tg/ maps while still retaining functionality. </br>
- Escape is made a little more complex in addition to a new area that is perfect for antagonist tendings. </br>
- There are no lethal guns on the station. Bear with us, but there's just no reason for them to be on the station, and they tend to make rounds shorter. Come up with more elaborate kill strategies. </br>
