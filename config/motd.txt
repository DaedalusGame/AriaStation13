This is a roleplaying server, we don't enforce it too badly but if you start killing people while you're NOT an antagonist, we're going to ban you. Stay in character and do things beneficial to the station. You will end up with a lot of bad shit if you don't. Make sure to read and abide by the rules and if you have any questions, feel free to adminhelp!
